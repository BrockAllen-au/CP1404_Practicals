## Lessons Learnt About "Clean Code"

- Using good variable names will help ensure the code is easily readable and identifies what is being stored in this
  variable e.g. a list
- Don't overuse comments. Adding too many comments makes the code "noisy" and makes it harder to read. If a lot of
  comments are required, perhaps look at variable names.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a great mantra. Checking that you're not repeating yourself not only makes your code
  cleaner, but normally makes it more efficient.
